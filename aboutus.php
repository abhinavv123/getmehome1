<h3>Why Get Me Home?</h3>
 You are stranded on a bustand in the sweltering summer heat, calling out for help to no one in particular.
 Drenched in your sweat and with a growing ache at the back of your head, you watch as the cars speed by at what feels like million miles an hour and the temperature shooting
 up to 50°C does nothing to aid your situation, rather it only increases your frustration.
 None of the cars passing by offers to help as you stare out into an endless stretch of asphalt with no hope of ever making it to your destination on time when suddenly, 
 you see an emerging ray of hope, as clear as light. No, it wasn’t the light, it was a bus.
 More precisely, it was an angel departed from heaven itself to get you home. However, you suddenly realize that it was nothing but a hallucination and the realization comes
